This Publisher Node is an ESP32-based telemetry device that measures network quality and GPS position, then publishes all data to an MQTT broker at regular intervals. It is designed to be part of a larger IoT measurement system where multiple devices stream signal quality and location data for real-time monitoring or offline analysis.
