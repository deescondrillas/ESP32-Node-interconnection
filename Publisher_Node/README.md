# Publisher Node –› Broker

This Publisher Node is an ESP32-based telemetry device that measures network quality (MBps) and GPS position (meters from a reference point), then publishes all data to an MQTT broker at regular intervals. It is designed to be part of a larger IoT measurement system where multiple devices stream signal quality and location data for real-time monitoring or offline analysis.
